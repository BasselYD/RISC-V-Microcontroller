# RISC-V-Microcontroller
A Microcontroller with a Pipelined RV32IM Processor with Zicsr extension, exception and interrupt
handling, a Direct-Mapped I-Cache, and parameterized Set-Associative D-Cache that communicates with
its peripherals (Memory SRAMs, UART, GPIO, and Timers) using an AHB Bus Matrix and APB.
